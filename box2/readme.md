# Welcome to box 2

Well, seems like you're good with javascript enough to create a new project from scratch using NPM and adding mocha test lib on it.

Now you need to init project again, install npm test dependencies (Mocha again) and make the code that actually will make tests work fine...

## Instructions

Just do the same steps you did before... it's easy! After this, go to test file and try to figure out how to make it works!

1. To finish this: write the code needed to pass the tests and move to the next box!
