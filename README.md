Js challenge...

This JS challenge is prepared to evaluate your abilities with JS language...

I'm using Mocha as a test-lib, just to make things easier and clearer for everybody.

Basically, the rules are:

* You have 60 mins to solve all these challenges

* You can use any resource you need (except communication : phone, personal, telepathy)

* You don't need to solve this in order (but I strongly recommend you to do so)

* All suggestions and contributions are welcome!
